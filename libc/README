This is an implementation of the C99 standard library for a 32-bit i386 PC.
It is intended for kernels or embedded software providing minimal system
services. POSIX compliance is not a goal and there is no support for threads.

Standard headers live in the include/ directory. The include/libc/ subdirectory
contains headers which define the abstract system interface and expose the
library's configuration and startup interface.

The library includes a test suite, which is built as a host system executable.
Use 'make suite' to compile it and 'make test' to run it.
