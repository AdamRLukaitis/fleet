This implementation of the C99 standard library builds on startc to provide a
pseudo-hosted runtime environment for embedded firmware projects or bare-metal
unikernel applications. POSIX compliance is not a goal; this is strictly a
C library.

The include/ directory contains those C standard headers which not already
provided by startc.

The library includes a test suite target which builds for the host system.
Use 'make suite' to compile it and 'make test' to run it.
