Libstartc is a minimal freestanding C runtime library intended for embedded
software or for an operating system kernel. Its target platform is an i386 PC
with a multiboot-compatible bootloader.

Libstartc provides a _start function, a multiboot header, and a small stack
suitable for kernel bootstrapping. On entry, after setting the stack pointer,
it configures the GDT for a flat 32-bit address space before jumping into the
application entrypoint:

extern void _startc(unsigned magic, struct multiboot_info *info);

The include/ directory contains a set of header files sufficient for a
conforming freestanding implementation of C99. Headers exposing runtime data
structures are located under include/startc/.
