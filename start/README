Libstart is a minimal freestanding C runtime library intended for embedded
software or for an operating system kernel. Its target platform is an i386 PC
with a multiboot-compatible bootloader.

Libstart provides a _start function, a multiboot header, and a small stack
suitable for kernel bootstrapping. It also configures the GDT for a flat
32-bit address space. Once the machine is setup to run C code, the _start
function will call this entrypoint:

extern void _kernel(unsigned magic, struct multiboot_info *info);

The include/ directory contains a set of header files sufficient for a
conforming freestanding implementation of C99.
The internal/ directory contains declarations for functions or data segments
created to support startup which may be useful later.
